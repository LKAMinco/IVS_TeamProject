PROFILING

As a profiler we used cProfile.

Profiling was done for 3 different input files:
        - 10 input values   (data_10.txt)
        - 100 input values  (data_100.txt)
        - 1000 input values (data_1000.txt)

These 3 files had been generated with 'generate_input_files' script,
which filled those files with pseudo random float numbers from range (-500, 500).

We used gprof2dot program to convert the output from the profiler into a dot graph.

# TODO ANALYZE PROFILER OUTPUT

You can view the output images (output_X.png, where X = {10, 100, 1000})
located in 'profiling_data' folder.
