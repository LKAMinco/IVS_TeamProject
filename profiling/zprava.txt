PROFILING

As a profiler we used cProfile - in PyCharm

Profiling was done for 3 different input files:
        - 10 input values   (data_10.txt)
        - 100 input values  (data_100.txt)
        - 1000 input values (data_1000.txt)

These 3 files had been generated with 'generate' script,
which filled mentioned files with pseudo random float numbers from range (-500, 500).


# TODO ANALYZE PROFILER OUTPUT

You can view the output images (output_X.png, where X = {10, 100, 1000})
located in the current folder.

To review pstat files generated by us - located in 'pstat_output' folder directly in PyCharm,
open PyCharm (if you have it installed) - from the main menu choose 'Tools', then 'Open CProfile snapshot'
and select desired pstat file.

To emulate our results in PyCharm(Professional ver. only),
